      " In a first conditional sentence, the verb in the conditional clause (if-clause) is usually in the present simple tense. For example, in the sentence \"If it rains, I will take an umbrella.\", the conditional clause \"it rains\" is in the present simple tense. However, note that some teachers might also accept the past simple form for hypothetical or timeless conditions, such as \"If it rained, I would take an umbrella.\" But the more common and accepted form for a first conditional sentence is using the present simple tense in the if-clause.\n",

      "Raw LLM Answer to: What does the word unless mean in conditional sentences?\n",
      " In English, the word \"unless\" is used to introduce a condition that must not be met for something to occur or be true. It's often used in if-then statements, where it negates the condition, implying that if the specified event or condition does not happen, then another event or statement will follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example: \"I will go to the party unless it rains.\" This sentence means that the speaker will go to the party only if it doesn't rain. If it does rain, they won't go.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, \"unless\" is used in conditional sentences to indicate a condition that must not occur or be true for something else to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "Raw LLM Answer to: Which conditional is used to describe imaginary past situations?\n",
      " The conditional that is used to describe imaginary past situations or hypothetical past events is called the Past Conditional. It is formed using the auxiliary verbs 'had' (for subject) and 'have'/'has' (for third person singular subject), followed by the base form of the main verb and past participle of the auxiliary verb for negation or questions. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "* If I had known about the party earlier, I would have gone.\n",
      "* If she had eaten breakfast, she wouldn't feel hungry now.\n",
      "* Had he studied more, he might have passed the exam.\n",
      "* Would you have gone to the concert if it hadn't been raining?\n",
      "\n",
      "This conditional tense is used to express events that are unreal or hypothetical, and often involves a 'if' clause that describes an imaginary or impossible situation in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "Raw LLM Answer to: Can we use would in the if-clause of a conditional sentence?\n",
      " Yes, you can use \"would\" in the if-clause of a conditional sentence to indicate a hypothetical or unlikely situation. This is known as the second conditional. Here's an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I were rich, I would buy a big house. (This sentence implies that the speaker is not currently rich.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, if you use \"were\" without \"would,\" it usually indicates a more likely or unrealized situation in the present or past. This is called the third conditional:\n",
      "\n",
      "If I were rich, I had bought a big house by now. (This sentence implies that something happened in the past that didn't make you rich.)\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "Raw LLM Answer to: What is the main difference between first and second conditionals?\n",
      " The main difference between First Conditional and Second Conditional lies in their structure, context, and implication.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. First Conditional (If + present simple / will + infinitive): It refers to real or possible situations that are likely to happen in the future as a result of a present fact or condition. For example: \"If it rains, we will stay at home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Second Conditional (If + past simple / would + infinitive): It deals with hypothetical or imaginary situations that are unlikely to occur in the present or near future. These situations are contrary to reality for the speaker. For example: \"If I had a million dollars, I would buy a mansion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, First Conditional is about real possibilities or predictions based on current conditions, while Second Conditional deals with hypothetical or unreal situations.\n"
